# Overall Description of Hotel
In this project, we created a website and database to support a hotel’s reservation system.  
<br> This is a small and special hotel.

<br> The hotel is located on 41st Street in midtown Manhattan in an older 5-story building.  It has 20 guest rooms spread over the four upper floors. Half of the guest rooms have a single king-sized bed and the others have 2 queens.  On each of the four upper floors, there is one suite.  Suites on the top two floors have king beds and on the lower two floors they have queen beds. Guests may smoke in all of the top floor rooms but none of the others.  


# Current pricing 
Nightly rates are based upon room (not person):
•	rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floor are $250 per night (Superior)
•	rooms on the 4th and 5th floor have better views and are $350 per night (Deluxe)
•	all the suites are $500 per night as they are larger.  

# Reservation Rules
Customers have to select the dates for their reservation, the type of room they want, their bed type and smoking preferences.  
<br> When customers make a reservation they must provide, their name, address, loyalty card number (if they have one) and the number of people who will be staying in the room.  There is a maximum of 2 people in the King and Double rooms and a maximum of 4 people in a suite.  When making a reservation, the customer can indicate if they want breakfast to be included.  The cost of breakfast is $20 per person, except if a loyalty number is provided in which case it is free.
<br> It is not possible to make a partial reservation.  If the same room matching the reservation criteria is not available for all of the nights requested, the reservation should not be made.
<br> If it is possible to fulfill a reservation, a specific room should be reserved.
