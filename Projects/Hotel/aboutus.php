        <p>Hey I'm Leslie, the founder of Home Sweet Home. </p>
            <p>I’m obsessed with exploring the world, meeting amazing people and
            getting as lost as possible with my camera. I was on the road for 1467 days between 2014 – 2018,
            and the best places I visited were the ones where I felt like home.</p>
         <p>Currently living in New York, I want to make you feel the same. That's why I am taking a chance on
             changing everyone's view on hotel stays. Somehow it's all working out.</p>
